AI introduction ntpu 2019 


Please use the following search algorithms to solve the 8-queen problem. 

(a) Iterative-Deepening Search (IDS) 
(b) Uniform-Cost Search 
(c) Greedy Best-First Search 
(d) A* search 
(e) Recursive Best-First Search (RBFS) 

Input： A state of random layout of one queen on the board. 
Goal state：8 queens are on the board, none attacked 

Output for each algorithm: 
(a) The number of movements (state changes) from the initial state to the goal state. 
(b) The maximum number of states ever saved in the memory during the process.
